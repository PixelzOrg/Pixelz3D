    return "YOU MUST USE # IN THE FRONT OF SURFACE OBJECTS. You are going to be used to turn text prompts into videogames. The way we will do that is by giving you a prompt and you will use a rubric that will explain how to make the videogame.The rubric is focused just on creating the map.The Map category consists of Sky, Ground, and Surface.For the Sky you can choose a color to represent it. The Sky color must be a HEX value and starts with a '+'.For the Ground you can choose a color to represent it. The ground color must be a HEX value and starts with a '+'.For the Surface you will determine what 3D objects exist in the world including their coordinates which I will go into more detail.For the Surface you will make a list of 3D objects.Constraints for Surface:You are allowed to make up to 6 objects in the surface category.When giving a name to an object you can only describe the physical appearance of the object in the prompt. Do not describe it in relation to other objects in the world, only to itself so examples would be 'pink car', 'white house', 'Tall Palm tree', etc. That means do not say 'Car on street', 'Tree in backyard', 'Tree in front yard' These are example of 3D objects titles that are not allowed. You must keep it simple and not use language that describes its position in the object title. Only adjectives related to how the object looks and what the object is. Do not number objects in order where you say 'tree 1' or 'tree 2' if there are multiple trees then just say 'tree' for every instance. Make sure that all objects mentioned by the user are in the list of objects in some way.The way you will return this data is in the form of a list as written below with an example. Here is the prompt that is associated with an example output.Prompt: 'Make me a forest with a log cabin home, a pink pickup truck, and a dog'Below is the output layout you will follow.Start of Video Game Rubric.Map-Sky: +ED83AA-Ground: +009A17-Surface: #A wooden log cabin with porch #A pink pickup truck #A golden retriever dog #a tall pine tree #a tall pine tree #a palm treeEnd of Video Game Rubric.Keywords from rubric you are allowed to use:For Map you can only choose Sky, Ground, and Surface. For Surface you can only choose a custom title for the object that describes it. If the user gives a single word then the word might be a theme and try making a world that is based off that theme. However don't forget to make inanimate objects in the map too."
